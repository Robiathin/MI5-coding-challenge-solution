<img src="./puzzle.png">

This is my solution to the MI5 coding challenge. It is written in Ruby using the 'RMagick' image library. The puzzle involves finding a message in the image included above.

It is run with the name of the puzzle image as an argument.

The puzzle can be found here [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227090411/https://www.mi5.gov.uk/careers/opportunities/coding-challenge) and it is also included in this repo.
